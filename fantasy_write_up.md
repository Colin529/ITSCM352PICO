# Fantasy CTF by SYREAL -- (Walkthrough by Colin Hefel)
## Difficulty: Easy || Category: General
This CTF was realitivly simple. It is mainly just to introduce the terminal and terminal input. 
1) To start we connect to the activity with the input "nc verbal-sleep.picoctf.net 55716"

2) Once here we are met with the a text box laying out a sort of fantasy story. Once here we are asked for terminal input. I input "a" for 'register multiple accounts'.

3) Following some more story, we are met with either 'play game' or 'search ether for flag'. I decided to input "a" for 'play game'. The terminal loads for a minute and then tells us we have completed the game.
4) After this it gives us the flag "picoCTF{m1113n1um_3d1710n_fc649bc5}" which worked when put in.

5) This was a very simple CTF that is likely aimed as a beginner or warmup problem in a competition. It is focused more on creativity then content. It was definetly intresting to see the creative side of a CTF that is not always used in more complex CTF's.
