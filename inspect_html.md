# Inspect HTML BY LT 'SYREAL' JONES

1) This challenge was also a pretty simple starter CTF introducing the idea of being able to inspect HTML code on a web browser.
2) This lab was pretty short, all that happened was visiting the included webpage we are met with a bunch of placeholder text.
3) Using the inspect tool we quickly see the flag as a comment in the HTML body.

4) This challenge shows the basic of obviously HTML web inspection. But more broadly giving new CTF participants to look where the average person may not.
